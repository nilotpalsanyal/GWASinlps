Description: Package GWASinlps performs variable selection with data from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), or other high-dimensional data, combining in an iterative framework, the computational efficiency of the screen-and-select variable selection approach based on some association learning and the parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided by the use of nonlocal priors as described in Sanyal et al. (2018) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty472>.
